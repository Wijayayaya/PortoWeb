        <p className="slide-in">Iâ€™m a 20-year-old student and aspiring web developer specializing in front-end technologies such as React, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. My journey began with a curiosity about how websites are built, which has now turned into a passion for developing seamless and aesthetic digital experiences.

          I am also expanding my skill set with MySQL to better understand and manage data-driven applications. My goal is to continuously grow as a developer and contribute to projects that make a difference.
